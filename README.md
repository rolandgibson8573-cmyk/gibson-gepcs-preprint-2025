# Gibson Emotional-Photonic Coherence System (GEPCS) Preprint Repo

## Overview
A closed-form synergy tensor from 31k+ emotional regulation events that suppresses dysregulation cascades (61% → <1%) and boosts room-temp photonic coherence by orders of magnitude. Full details in attached summary; equations/X×X tensor under NDA.

## Key Impacts
- Zero-med trauma resolution in weeks.
- Nano-Kelvin effective temps without cryogenics.
- QEE Theorem: Entangled empathy for human-AI futures.
